Her hospitality has taken an interest  
People around her wish her hospitality  
although a second slip of plant wilted 
butterflies swarmed at her 
she trembles society she stops at her final clue 
To isolate herself 
So she flew to a lonely building  
The building gave the girl an umbrella 
And guide the helpless girl  
Somewhere of a blissful red 
where no one sees.”"
