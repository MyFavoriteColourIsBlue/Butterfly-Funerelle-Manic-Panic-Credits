Her only choice was to be ignorant 
butterflies kept pestering the girl 
and then something sprouted from her hair  
a flower from the butterflies  
Overtime as the flower puts pressure  
until the flower was in her final stage 
The girl grabs one of the butterflies 
And took it piece by piece 
And then another 
And then another 
Villain and violent”
